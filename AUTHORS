This project is based on the wiki2pdf project by Stephan Walter. 
The original wiki2pdf code was written by
    Stephan Walter <stephan.walter@epfl.ch>
    Forest Timothy Gregg <fgregg@cs.uchicago.edu>
    Lexor <lexorpedia@myway.com>
    Andi Albrecht <andialbrecht@web.de>
but nothing of their code is still present in the current version, since the
program was rewritten in Haskell using entirely different algorithms.
