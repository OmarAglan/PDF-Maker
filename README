================================================================================

MediaWiki to LaTeX is a simple tool that will fetch a MediaWiki article
including all its content recursively (subpages, pictures, etc.) and will
generate a LaTeX article from it. By default it will call a LaTeX compiler if
available to generate a PDF. This process can be controlled with command-line
parameters. See the man page.

The LaTeX output is customizable with templates. See the man page for examples.

This software is written in Haskell and requires the ghc collection for
building.  Note that whereas the compile-time requirements are quite demanding
(ghc is huge!), these are not needed for runtime. In fact, the tool is quite
lightweight as it has virtually no dependency.
