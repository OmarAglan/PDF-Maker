Version 7.38
	* src
        the tachyon subproject has been started. Its goal is to demostrate
        the maximum possible speed of a mediawiki to latex conversion see
        folder tachyon. djvu files are now processed correctly. list of 
        contributors is faster by removing lazy evaluation. Source codes
        which contain high unicode codepoint character are not not highlighted
        anymore and thus don't cause LaTeX compiler aborts anymore. Some 
        seldom occuring bug in the processing of complex tables have been
        fixed. highlighting environment now begin with a newline to make sure
        they compile in LaTeX. A an addition mode has been added to allow
        for loading all pages from a toc page but only those which are 
        children of the toc page with respect to the url paths. If a cell in
        a table itself contains multiple tables, those inner tables are
        limited in width to half of the width of the outer cell. A bug that
        prohibited --bookmode together with --epub was fixed. A bug on 
        nested lists / enumerations / itemizations was fixed. If vector
        graphcis is requested, the svg images are not rasterized in epub
        but instead kept as svg in epub output. Quationsmakes and numeric
        html entities are now correcty coverted from the parse tree to plain
        text causing them to appear correctly when typesetting source codes.
        url fed in to mediawiki2latex from the command line of the web 
        interface may does not longer need to be escaped in url escaping.
        stl 3d graphics files are kicked out entirely. It is possible to use
        a source code in the caption of an image.
Version 7.37
	* src
        the bug introduced in 7.36 that caused the list of contributors to be 
        incomplete was fixed. a new faster but less memory efficient parser
        is used to extract the list of contributors from the history pages on
        the wiki. The same applies to the list of figures. This causes 
        mediawiki2latex to run roughly 30% faster altogether.  
Version 7.36
	* src
        let a be the fact that mediawiki2latex is asked to gernerate a PDF file
        or a zip file with the corresponding latex source (which is equivalent
        to the fact that neigther of the options -b, -d, --epub, --odt 
        are present).
        let b be the fact that the input is a book or collection (which 
        is equivalent to the fact that -k or --bookmode command line option is present).
        if both a and b a are true then the memory consumption is reduced by usually at least an
        order of magnitue. This is why the server now supports up to four requests in parallel
        and up to four hours per request.
Version 7.35
	* src
        table column precompilation now happens in a single LaTeX run. This increases speed. 
        Server can run bookmode again. Formulars inside captions of images galleries
        work now. Navboxes are now displayed collapsed. Support for "track" hmtl tag.
        Support von "source" tag with empty string inside. Links to cateories not 
        displayed anymore. 
Version 7.34
	* src
        memory consumption with -k signifikantly reduced due to exchange of serialization library
	message displayed in server mode which points users where to look for the downloaded files
        some fixes that allows use with edutech wiki from the univeristy of Geneva
        the following combinations of parameters are now also possible -k -m as well as -k -i as well as -k -t
        -k works with -b. The combination of -k -d is bascially possible but might fail due to a bug in 
        libreoffice at large documents
Version 7.33
