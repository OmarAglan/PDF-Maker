Version 7.37
	* src
        the bug introduced in 7.36 that caused the list of contributors to be 
        incomplete was fixed. a new faster but less memory efficient parser
        is used to extract the list of contributors from the history pages on
        the wiki. The same applies to the list of figures. This causes 
        mediawiki2latex to run roughly 30% faster altogether.  
Version 7.36
	* src
        let a be the fact that mediawiki2latex is asked to gernerate a PDF file
        or a zip file with the corresponding latex source (which is equivalent
        to the fact that neigther of the options -b, -d, --epub, --odt 
        are present).
        let b be the fact that the input is a book or collection (which 
        is equivalent to the fact that -k or --bookmode command line option is present).
        if both a and b a are true then the memory consumption is reduced by usually at least an
        order of magnitue. This is why the server now supports up to four requests in parallel
        and up to four hours per request.
Version 7.35
	* src
        table column precompilation now happens in a single LaTeX run. This increases speed. 
        Server can run bookmode again. Formulars inside captions of images galleries
        work now. Navboxes are now displayed collapsed. Support for "track" hmtl tag.
        Support von "source" tag with empty string inside. Links to cateories not 
        displayed anymore. 
Version 7.34
	* src
        memory consumption with -k signifikantly reduced due to exchange of serialization library
	message displayed in server mode which points users where to look for the downloaded files
        some fixes that allows use with edutech wiki from the univeristy of Geneva
        the following combinations of parameters are now also possible -k -m as well as -k -i as well as -k -t
        -k works with -b. The combination of -k -d is bascially possible but might fail due to a bug in 
        libreoffice at large documents
